## About

It is a dedicated educational platform that will allow teachers to share homework assignments, chat and (in the future) conduct online lessons with their students. The application will allow the creation of a teacher or student account and will include all the necessary tools that will be put in the hands of the user. I plan to divide the production of the app into several stages:

1. Create the entire frontend based on a mock-up and handle the core functions using appropriately configured tables in _Supabase_ - **done**,
2. Create a complete database in _PostgreSQL_, with mapped structure and relationships as in Supabase - greater efficiency and control - **in progress**,
3. Create a complete backend in _Java_ based on microservices so that the frontend, backend and database can be connected - **in progress**,
4. Combine all components and disconnect Supabase - **not started**.

## Links & Tools

**Frontend:** HTML, SCSS (CSS preprocessor), React (incl. React-Hook-Form, Redux), TypeScript, GraphQL, Apollo Client, Vite, Cypress, Yup

_The application will be developed in an MVP model and I can not show more.._
